How-To Guides
=============

In the following guides you can find tips and best practices how to cope with some common tasks. While searching this page for particular keywords can give you quick results, reading the whole section should help you to learn some of the Dredd’s core concepts and usual ways how to approach problems when testing with Dredd.

Isolation of HTTP Transactions
------------------------------

Requests in the API description usually aren’t sorted in order to comply with logical workflow of the tested application. To get the best results from testing with Dredd, you should ensure each resource action (`API Blueprint <https://apiblueprint.org/>`__) or operation (`Swagger <https://swagger.io/>`__) is executed in isolated context. This can be easily achieved using :ref:`hooks <hooks>`, where you can provide your own setup and teardown code for each HTTP transaction.

You should understand that testing with Dredd is an analogy to **unit tests** of your application code. In unit tests, each unit should be testable without any dependency on other units or previous tests.

Example
~~~~~~~

Common case is to solve a situation where we want to test deleting of a resource. Obviously, to test deleting of a resource, we first need to create one. However, the order of HTTP transactions can be pretty much random in the API description.

To solve the situation, it’s recommended to isolate the deletion test by :ref:`hooks <hooks>`. Providing ``before`` hook, we can ensure the database fixture will be present every time Dredd will try to send the request to delete a category item.

API Blueprint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: apiblueprint

   FORMAT: 1A

   # Categories API

   ## Categories [/categories]

   ### Create a Category [POST]
   + Response 201

   ## Category [/category/{id}]
   + Parameters
       + id: 42 (required)

   ### Delete a Category [DELETE]
   + Response 204

   ## Category Items [/category/{id}/items]
   + Parameters
       + id: 42 (required)

   ## Create an Item [POST]
   + Response 201

To have an idea where we can hook our arbitrary code, we should first ask Dredd to list all available transaction names:

::

   $ dredd api-description.apib http://127.0.0.1:3000 --names
   info: Categories > Create a category
   info: Category > Delete a category
   info: Category Items > Create an item

Now we can create a ``hooks.js`` file. The file will contain setup and teardown of the database fixture:

.. code-block:: javascript

   hooks = require('hooks');
   db = require('./src/db');

   beforeAll(function() {
     db.cleanUp();
   });

   afterEach(function(transaction) {
     db.cleanUp();
   });

   before('Category > Delete a Category', function() {
     db.createCategory({id: 42});
   });

   before('Category Items > Create an Item', function() {
     db.createCategory({id: 42});
   });

Swagger
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: yaml

   swagger: "2.0"
   info:
     version: "0.0.0"
     title: Categories API
     license:
       name: MIT

   basePath: /
   schemes:
     - http
   consumes:

   produces:
     - application/json
   paths:
     /categories:
       post:
         responses:
           200:
             description: ""
     /category/{id}:
       delete:
         parameters:
           - name: id
             in: path
             required: true
             type: string
             enum:
               - "42"
         responses:
           200:
             description: ""
     /category/{id}/items:
       post:
         parameters:
           - name: id
             in: path
             required: true
             type: string
             enum:
               - "42"
         responses:
           200:
             description: ""

To have an idea where we can hook our arbitrary code, we should first ask Dredd to list all available transaction names:

::

   $ dredd api-description.yml http://127.0.0.1:3000 --names
   info: /categories > POST > 200 > application/json
   info: /category/{id} > DELETE > 200 > application/json
   info: /category/{id}/items > POST > 200 > application/json

Now we can create a ``hooks.js`` file. The file will contain setup and teardown of the database fixture:

.. code-block:: javascript

   hooks = require('hooks');
   db = require('./src/db');

   beforeAll(function() {
     db.cleanUp();
   });

   afterEach(function(transaction) {
     db.cleanUp();
   });

   before('/category/{id}', function() {
     db.createCategory({id: 42});
   });

   before('/category/{id}/items', function() {
     db.createCategory({id: 42});
   });

Testing API Workflows
---------------------

Often you want to test a sequence of steps, a scenario, rather than just one request-response pair in isolation. Since the API description formats are quite limited in their support of documenting scenarios, Dredd probably isn’t the best tool to provide you with this kind of testing. There are some tricks though, which can help you to work around some of the limitations.

.. note::
   `API Blueprint <https://apiblueprint.org/>`__ prepares direct support for testing and scenarios. Interested? Check out `apiaryio/api-blueprint#21 <https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/issues/21>`__!

To test various scenarios, you will want to write each of them into a separate API description document. To load them during a single test run, use the ``--path`` option (:ref:`docs <path-p>`).

For workflows to work properly, you’ll also need to keep **shared context** between individual HTTP transactions. You can use :ref:`hooks <hooks>` in order to achieve that. See tips on how to :ref:`pass data between transactions <sharing-data-between-steps-in-request-stash>`.

API Blueprint Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Imagine we have a simple workflow described:

.. code-block:: apiblueprint

   FORMAT: 1A

   # My Scenario

   ## POST /login

   + Request (application/json)

           {"username": "john", "password": "d0e"}


   + Response 200 (application/json)

           {"token": "s3cr3t"}

   ## GET /cars

   + Response 200 (application/json)

           [
               {"id": "42", "color": "red"}
           ]

   ## PATCH /cars/{id}
   + Parameters
       + id: 42 (string, required)

   + Request (application/json)

           {"color": "yellow"}

   + Response 200 (application/json)

           {"id": 42, "color": "yellow"}

Writing Hooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To have an idea where we can hook our arbitrary code, we should first ask Dredd to list all available transaction names:

::

   $ dredd api-description.apib http://127.0.0.1:3000 --names
   info: /login > POST
   info: /cars > GET
   info: /cars/{id} > PATCH

Now we can create a ``hooks.js`` file. The code of the file will use global ``stash`` variable to share data between requests:

.. code-block:: javascript

   hooks = require('hooks');
   db = require('./src/db');

   stash = {}

   // Stash the token we've got
   after('/login > POST', function (transaction) {
     stash.token = JSON.parse(transaction.real.body).token;
   });

   // Add the token to all HTTP transactions
   beforeEach(function (transaction) {
     if (stash.token) {
       transaction.request.headers['X-Api-Key'] = stash.token
     };
   });

   // Stash the car ID we've got
   after('/cars > GET', function (transaction) {
     stash.carId = JSON.parse(transaction.real.body).id;
   });

   // Replace car ID in request with the one we've stashed
   before('/cars/{id} > PATCH', function (transaction) {
     transaction.fullPath = transaction.fullPath.replace('42', stash.carId)
     transaction.request.uri = transaction.fullPath
   })

                 color:
                   type: string

Writing Hooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To have an idea where we can hook our arbitrary code, we should first ask Dredd to list all available transaction names:

::

   $ dredd api-description.yml http://127.0.0.1:3000 --names
   info: /login > POST > 200 > application/json
   info: /cars > GET > 200 > application/json
   info: /cars/{id} > PATCH > 200 > application/json

Now we can create a ``hooks.js`` file. The code of the file will use global ``stash`` variable to share data between requests:

.. code-block:: javascript

   hooks = require('hooks');
   db = require('./src/db');

   stash = {}

   // Stash the token we've got
   after('/login > POST > 200 > application/json', function (transaction) {
     stash.token = JSON.parse(transaction.real.body).token;
   });

   // Add the token to all HTTP transactions
   beforeEach(function (transaction) {
     if (stash.token) {
       transaction.request.headers['X-Api-Key'] = stash.token
     };
   });

   // Stash the car ID we've got
   after('/cars > GET > 200 > application/json', function (transaction) {
     stash.carId = JSON.parse(transaction.real.body).id;
   });

   // Replace car ID in request with the one we've stashed
   before('/cars/{id} > PATCH > 200 > application/json', function (transaction) {
     transaction.fullPath = transaction.fullPath.replace('42', stash.carId)
     transaction.request.uri = transaction.fullPath
   })

Making Dredd Validation Stricter
--------------------------------

API Blueprint or Swagger files are usually created primarily with *documentation* in mind. But what’s enough for documentation doesn’t need to be enough for *testing*.

That applies to both `MSON <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/mson/specification.html>`__ (a language powering API Blueprint’s `Attributes <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/specification.html#def-attributes-section>`__ sections) and `JSON Schema <http://json-schema.org/>`__ (a language powering the Swagger format and API Blueprint’s `Schema <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/specification.html#def-schema-section>`__ sections).

In following sections you can learn about how to deal with common scenarios.

Avoiding Additional Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you describe a JSON body which has attributes ``name`` and ``size``, the following payload will be considered as correct:

.. code-block:: json

   {"name": "Sparta", "size": 300, "luck": false}

It’s because in both `MSON <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/mson/specification.html>`__ and `JSON Schema <http://json-schema.org/>`__ additional properties are not forbidden by default.

-  In API Blueprint’s `Attributes <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/specification.html#def-attributes-section>`__ sections you can mark your object with ```fixed-type`` <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/mson/specification.html#353-type-attribute>`__, which doesn’t allow additional properties.
-  In API Blueprint’s `Schema <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/specification.html#def-schema-section>`__ sections and in Swagger you can use ``additionalProperties: false`` (`docs <https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#properties>`__) on the objects.

Requiring Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you describe a JSON body which has attributes ``name`` and ``size``, the following payload will be considered as correct:

.. code-block:: json

   {"name": "Sparta"}

It’s because properties are optional by default in both `MSON <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/mson/specification.html>`__ and `JSON Schema <http://json-schema.org/>`__ and you need to explicitly specify them as required.

-  In API Blueprint’s `Attributes <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/specification.html#def-attributes-section>`__ section, you can use ```required`` <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/mson/specification.html#353-type-attribute>`__.
-  In API Blueprint’s `Schema <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/specification.html#def-schema-section>`__ sections and in Swagger you can use ``required`` (`docs <https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#required-properties>`__), where you list the required properties. (Note this is true only for the `Draft v4 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04>`__ JSON Schema, in older versions the ``required`` functionality was done differently.)

Validating Structure of Array Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you describe an array of items, where each of the items should have a ``name`` property, the following payload will be considered as correct:

.. code-block:: json

   [{"name": "Sparta"}, {"title": "Athens"}, "Thebes"]

That’s because in `MSON <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/mson/specification.html>`__, the default behavior is that you are specifying what *may* appear in the array.

-  In API Blueprint’s `Attributes <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/specification.html#def-attributes-section>`__ sections you can mark your array with ``fixed-type`` (`docs  <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/mson/specification.html#353-type-attribute>`__), which doesn’t allow array items of a different structure then specified.
-  In API Blueprint’s `Schema <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/specification.html#def-schema-section>`__ sections and in Swagger make sure to learn about how `validation of arrays <https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/array.html>`__ exactly works.

Validating Specific Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you describe a JSON body which has attributes ``name`` and ``size``, the following payload will be considered as correct:

.. code-block:: json

   {"name": "Sparta", "size": 42}

If the size should be always equal to 300, you need to specify the fact in your API description.

-  In API Blueprint’s `Attributes <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/specification.html#def-attributes-section>`__ sections you can mark your property with ``fixed`` (`docs <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/mson/specification.html#353-type-attribute>`__), which turns the sample value into a required value. You can also use ``enum`` (`docs <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/mson/specification.html#212-structure-types>`__) to provide a set of possible values.
-  In API Blueprint’s `Schema <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/specification.html#def-schema-section>`__ sections and in Swagger you can use ``enum`` (`docs <https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/generic.html#enumerated-values>`__) with one or more possible values.

Integrating Dredd with Your Test Suite
--------------------------------------

Generally, if you want to add Dredd to your existing test suite, you can just save Dredd configuration in the ``dredd.yml`` file and add call for ``dredd`` command to your task runner.

There are also some packages which make the integration a piece of cake:

-  `grunt-dredd <https://github.com/mfgea/grunt-dredd>`__
-  `dredd-rack <https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/dredd-rack>`__
-  `meteor-dredd <https://github.com/storeness/meteor-dredd>`__

To find more, search for ``dredd`` in your favorite language’s package index.

Continuous Integration
----------------------

It’s a good practice to make Dredd part of your continuous integration workflow. Only that way you can ensure that application code you’ll produce won’t break the contract you provide in your API documentation.

Dredd’s interactive configuration wizard, ``dredd init``, can help you with setting up ``dredd.yml`` configuration file and with modifying or generating CI configuration files for `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/>`__ or `CircleCI <https://circleci.com/>`__.

If you prefer to add Dredd yourself or you look for inspiration on how to add Dredd to other continuous integration services, see examples below. When testing in CI, always pin your Dredd version to a specific number and upgrade to newer releases manually.

.. _circleyml-configuration-file-for-circleci:

``.circleci/config.yml`` Configuration File for `CircleCI <https://circleci.com/>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   version: 2
   jobs:
     build:
       docker:
         - image: circleci/node:latest
       steps:
         - checkout
         - run: npm install dredd@x.x.x --no-optional --global
         - run: dredd apiary.apib http://127.0.0.1:3000

.. _travisyml-configuration-file-for-travis-ci:

``.travis.yml`` Configuration File for `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   before_install:
     - npm install dredd@x.x.x --no-optional --global
   before_script:
     - dredd apiary.apib http://127.0.0.1:3000

Authenticated APIs
------------------

Dredd supports all common authentication schemes:

-  Basic access authentication
-  Digest access authentication
-  OAuth (any version)
-  CSRF tokens
-  …

Use ``user`` setting in your configuration file or ``--user`` argument to provide HTTP basic authentication:

::

   --user=user:password

Most of the authentication schemes use HTTP header for carrying the authentication data. If you don’t want to add authentication HTTP header to every request in the API description, you can instruct Dredd to do it for you:

::

   --header="Authorization: Basic YmVuOnBhc3M="

Sending Multipart Requests
--------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../test/fixtures/request/multipart-form-data.apib
  :language: apiblueprint

.. literalinclude:: ../test/fixtures/request/multipart-form-data.yaml
  :language: yaml

Sending Form Data
-----------------

.. literalinclude:: ../test/fixtures/request/application-x-www-form-urlencoded.apib
  :language: apiblueprint

.. literalinclude:: ../test/fixtures/request/application-x-www-form-urlencoded.yaml
  :language: yaml

Working with Images and other Binary Bodies
-------------------------------------------

The API description formats generally do not provide a way to describe binary content. The easiest solution is to describe only the media type, to :ref:`leave out the body <empty-response-body>`, and to handle the rest using :ref:`hooks`.

Binary Request Body
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

API Blueprint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../test/fixtures/request/image-png.apib
  :language: apiblueprint

Swagger
^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../test/fixtures/request/image-png.yaml
  :language: yaml

Hooks
^^^^^

In hooks, you can populate the request body with real binary data. The data must be in a form of a `Base64-encoded <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64>`__ string.

.. literalinclude:: ../test/fixtures/request/image-png-hooks.js
  :language: javascript

Binary Response Body
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

API Blueprint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../test/fixtures/response/binary.apib
  :language: apiblueprint

Swagger
^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../test/fixtures/response/binary.yaml
  :language: yaml

.. note::
   Do not use the explicit ``binary`` or ``bytes`` formats with response bodies, as Dredd is not able to properly work with those (`fury-adapter-swagger#193 <https://github.com/apiaryio/fury-adapter-swagger/issues/193>`__).

Hooks
~~~~~

In hooks, you can either assert the body:

.. literalinclude:: ../test/fixtures/response/binary-assert-body-hooks.js
  :language: javascript

Or you can ignore it:

.. literalinclude:: ../test/fixtures/response/binary-ignore-body-hooks.js
  :language: javascript

Multiple Requests and Responses
-------------------------------

.. note::
   For details on this topic see also :ref:`How Dredd Works With HTTP Transactions <choosing-http-transactions>`.

API Blueprint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test multiple requests and responses within one action in Dredd, you need to cluster them into pairs:

.. code-block:: apiblueprint

   FORMAT: 1A

   # My API

   ## Resource [/resource/{id}]

   + Parameters
       + id: 42 (required)

   ###  Update Resource [PATCH]

   + Request (application/json)

           {"color": "yellow"}


   + Response 200 (application/json)

           {"color": "yellow", "id": 1}


   + Request Edge Case (application/json)

           {"weight": 1}

   + Response 400 (application/vnd.error+json)

           {"message": "Validation failed"}

Dredd will detect two HTTP transaction examples and will compile following transaction names:

::

   $ dredd api-description.apib http://127.0.0.1 --names
   info: Beginning Dredd testing...
   info: Resource > Update Resource > Example 1
   info: Resource > Update Resource > Example 2

In case you need to perform particular request with different URI parameters and standard inheritance of URI parameters isn’t working for you, try :ref:`modifying transaction before its execution <modifying-transaction-request-body-prior-to-execution>` in hooks.

Swagger
~~~~~~~

When using `Swagger <https://swagger.io/>`__ format, by default Dredd tests only responses with ``2xx`` status codes. Responses with other codes are marked as *skipped* and can be activated in :ref:`hooks <hooks>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var hooks = require('hooks');

   hooks.before('/resource > GET > 500 > application/json', function (transaction, done) {
     transaction.skip = false;
     done();
   });

.. _using-apiary-reporter-and-apiary-tests:

Using Apiary Reporter and Apiary Tests
--------------------------------------

Command-line output of complex HTTP responses and expectations can be hard to read. To tackle the problem, you can use Dredd to send test reports to `Apiary <https://apiary.io/>`__. Apiary provides a comfortable interface for browsing complex test reports:

::

   $ dredd apiary.apib http://127.0.0.1 --reporter=apiary
   warn: Apiary API Key or API Project Subdomain were not provided. Configure Dredd to be able to save test reports alongside your Apiary API project: http://dredd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to-guides/#using-apiary-reporter-and-apiary-tests

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you can see on the screenshot, the test reports are anonymous by default and will expire after some time. However, if you provide Apiary credentials, your test reports will appear on the *Tests* page of your API Project. This is great especially for introspection of test reports from Continuous Integration.

To get and setup credentials, just follow the tutorial in Apiary:

.. figure:: _images/apiary-tests-tutorial.png
   :alt: Apiary Tests Tutorial

   Apiary Tests Tutorial

As you can see, the parameters go like this:

::

   $ dredd -c apiaryApiKey:<Apiary API Key> -c apiaryApiName:<API Project Subdomain>

In addition to using parameters and ``dredd.yml``, you can also use environment variables:

-  ``APIARY_API_KEY=<Apiary API Key>`` - Alternative way to pass credentials to Apiary Reporter.
-  ``APIARY_API_NAME=<API Project Subdomain>`` - Alternative way to pass credentials to Apiary Reporter.

When sending test reports to Apiary, Dredd inspects the environment where it was executed and sends some information about it alongside test results. Those are used mainly for detection whether the environment is Continuous Integration and also, they help you to identify individual test reports on the *Tests* page. You can use the following variables to tell Dredd what to send:

-  agent (string) - ``DREDD_AGENT`` or current user in the OS
-  hostname (string) - ``DREDD_HOSTNAME`` or hostname of the OS
-  CI (boolean) - looks for ``TRAVIS``, ``CIRCLE``, ``CI``, ``DRONE``, ``BUILD_ID``, …

.. _example-values-for-request-parameters:

Example Values for Request Parameters
-------------------------------------

While example values are natural part of the API Blueprint format, the Swagger specification allows them only for ``body`` request parameters (``schema.example``).

However, Dredd needs to know what values to use when testing described API, so it supports ``x-example`` `vendor extension property <https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#user-content-vendorExtensions>`__ to overcome the Swagger limitation:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ...
   paths:
     /cars:
       get:
         parameters:
           - name: limit
             in: query
             type: number
             x-example: 42

The ``x-example`` property is respected for all kinds of request parameters except of ``body`` parameters, where native ``schema.example`` should be used.

.. _removing-sensitive-data-from-test-reports:

Removing Sensitive Data from Test Reports
-----------------------------------------

Sometimes your API sends back sensitive information you don’t want to get disclosed in :ref:`Apiary Tests <using-apiary-reporter-and-apiary-tests>` or in your CI log. In that case you can use :ref:`Hooks <hooks>` to do sanitation. Before diving into examples below, do not forget to consider following:

-  Be sure to read :ref:`section about security <security>` first.
-  Only the ``transaction.test`` (:ref:`docs <transaction-test>`) object will make it to reporters. You don’t have to care about sanitation of the rest of the ``transaction`` (:ref:`docs <transaction>`) object.
-  The ``transaction.test.message`` and all the ``transaction.test.results.body.results.rawData.*.message`` properties contain validation error messages. While they’re very useful for learning about what’s wrong on command line, they can contain direct mentions of header names, header values, body properties, body structure, body values, etc., thus it’s recommended their contents are completely removed to prevent unintended leaks of sensitive information.
-  Without the ``transaction.test.results.body.results.rawData`` property :ref:`Apiary reporter <using-apiary-reporter-and-apiary-tests>` won’t be able to render green/red difference between payloads.
-  You can use :ref:`Ultimate ‘afterEach’ Guard <sanitation-ultimate-guard>` to make sure you won’t leak any sensitive data by mistake.
-  If your hooks crash, Dredd will send an error to reporters, alongside with current contents of the ``transaction.test`` (:ref:`docs <transaction-test>`) object. See the :ref:`Sanitation of Test Data of Transaction With Secured Erroring Hooks <sanitation-secured-erroring-hooks>` example to learn how to prevent this.
